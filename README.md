Problem 1 (100 points)
Develop a in–place algorithm called PartitionEvenOdd(A) that partitions
an array A in even and odd numbers. The algorithm must terminate with A
containing all its even elements preceding all its odd elements. For example, 
for input A =< 7, 17, 74, 21, 7, 9, 26, 10 >, the output might be
A =< 74, 10, 26, 17, 7, 21, 9, 7 > . PartitionEvenOdd must be an in–place
algorithm, which means that it may use only a constant memory space in
addition to A. In practice, this means that you may not use another temporary array.

(a) Write the pseudo–code for PartitionEvenOdd.
(b) What is the running time of PartitionEvenOdd. Briefly justify your answer.
(c) Discuss a possible implementation. If you provide one that works, you will earn extra points!

Exercise 2 (100 points)
You have a mixed pile of n nuts and n bolts and need to quickly find the
corresponding pairs of nuts and bolts. Each nut matches exactly one bolt,
and each bolt matches exactly one nut. By fitting a bolt and a nut together,
you can see which is bigger, but it is not possible to directly compare two
nuts or two bolts. Give an efficient algorithm for solving this problem. State
valid reasons as to why your algorithm is correct.
